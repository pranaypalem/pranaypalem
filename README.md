- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pranaypalem
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Robotic perception in various environments
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Robotic simulation and perception

## Skill Set

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**
  - Experienced in designing and training RL algorithms (Q-learning, DQN, PPO, etc.) for robotic control tasks.
  - Implemented RL solutions for path-following, pick-and-place, and motion optimization.

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):**
  - Familiar with indoor and outdoor mapping and localization tools like GMapping, Hector SLAM, and RTAB-Map.
  - Skilled at integrating sensor data (LIDAR, depth cameras) for robust map building and pose estimation.

- **ROS (Robot Operating System):**
  - Proficient in setting up ROS-based development environments, creating custom nodes, and leveraging ROS tools (rviz, rqt, rosbag).
  - Experienced with simulation in Gazebo and real-world deployment on robotic platforms.

- **Robotic Perception:**
  - Skilled in using libraries such as OpenCV and PCL for object detection, feature extraction, and point cloud processing.
  - Developed perception pipelines for tasks like environmental mapping and scene understanding.

- **Foldable Robotics:**
  - Researched and developed prototypes focusing on foldable mechanisms for efficient manufacturing and compact deployment.
  - Explored novel materials and designs to enable portable, space-saving robotic solutions.

- **Artificial Potential Field (APF):**
  - Implemented APF-based navigation for mobile robots, enhancing obstacle avoidance and path planning.
  - Experimented with optimizing APF to mitigate common issues like local minima.
